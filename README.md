# <my-portfolio>

## Description

I created this project in order to have a professional portfolio to show my future potential employers.
I learned quite a bit about CSS, especially with regards to flexbox elements.

## Usage

There is not much functionality to the website but one of the pictures does have a link to one of my projects. 
If you click the first picture, it should take you to my Prework Study Guide mini-project.

## Credits

Ray Badua helped me out a bit with flexbox and the things you can do with it. The help was primarily for CSS and I learned / was reminded of properties such as gap and flex-flow.

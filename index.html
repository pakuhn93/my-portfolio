            Hello, my name is Paul Kuhn. Ever since I was in kindergarten, I've always loved 
            computers. I used to be a computer science major at Cabrillo College in Aptos, 
            which is where I started my journey to becoming a programmer. I wasn't 
            meshing well with the typical college lifestyle of taking classes all day 
            and I had no clue how to study efficiently so I took some time off from 
            school to develop myself. During that time, I switched majors, taught 
            myself how to study efficiently, and became an accounting tutor for 
            Cuyamaca College. I eventually stumbled upon a coding boot camp, 
            which allowed me the chance to return to my coding roots in a style 
            that is much more adherent to my preferences. I have recently found 
            a passion in web development and I am elated to be able to share that 
            excitement with the world!

        <!-- My Work Text -->
        <p>
            A little about my work and style: 
            I like to make sure that my work is, first and foremost, easy to follow, 
            fix, edit, etc. I want something that is user-friendly. Websites that 
            jump around all over the place, have improperly grouped elements, 
            and have strange behaviors are not for me at all. The User Experience 
            is paramount to a successful website--even if that website is for personal 
            use. When the audience for the websites is satisfied then I am satisfied. 
            Organization is key. I wasn't an accounting major for nothing! All 
            my life I've organized things just for the fun of it. I remember 
            organizing my old trading cards, my toy cars, etc, because it felt 
            so satisfying. As far as design goes, I prefer a more minimalistic approach 
            so that the website is not overwhelming.
